## About ITP Thesis

ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative uses of media and technology — how they might augment, improve and bring delight and art into people’s lives. Perhaps the best way to describe us is a Center for the Recently Possible.


The ITP Thesis is just one semester long and is taught as a class within the two-year period. It is the one class that students work individually (i.e. not part of a team) and develop a project or their own choosing from concept through a proof-of-concept prototype.


The goal of an ITP education is that students leave here with the tools to do whatvever they want to do. Those tools include: knowing how to find out what they don’t know; to be ready for change, anticipate it; a willingness to experiment, fail, try again, etc; how to take an idea and make it real; to find their own strengths and deepen them; to follow your passions and trust their gut.


The faculty needs to see evidence both of mastery of these tools or qualities and of specific skills they have learned in their two years in the program.
