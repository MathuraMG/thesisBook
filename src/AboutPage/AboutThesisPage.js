        ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative uses of media and technology — how they might augment, improve and bring delight and art into people’s lives.
        Perhaps the best way to describe us is a Center for the Recently Possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ITP Thesis is just one semester long and is taught as a class within the two-year period.
        It is the one class that students work individually (i.e. not part of a team) and develop a project or their own choosing from concept through a proof-of-concept prototype.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of an ITP education is that students leave here with the tools to do whatvever they want to do.
        Those tools include:
        knowing how to find out what they don’t know;
        to be ready for change, anticipate it;
        a willingness to experiment, fail, try again, etc;
        how to take an idea and make it real;
        to find their own strengths and deepen them;
        to follow your passions and trust their gut.
      </p>

      <p>
        The faculty needs to see evidence both of mastery of these tools or qualities and of specific skills they have learned in their two years in the program.
