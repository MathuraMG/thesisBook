  You’re whimsical, witty, obsessed and serious
  Outrageous, political, playful and curious,
  Rigorous, hard-working, goofy and thoughtful,
  Faced with a world, to put it mildly, distraught-ful.
  The collection of projects you produced this semester:
  Imaginative, mind-blowing, you deserve a siesta…
  For now I’ll offer a few illustrations…
  From Behavior Change to Museums, Installations,
  Music, Performance, Data, UI and UX
  (Though this year’s there’s really not much about sex)
  A few about gender, we’re not total prigs:
  Menstruation, Black beauty, drag–thermochromic wigs,
  Shirts that will bite you if you tell me to smile,
  Chatbots to organize, to converse with a child,
  A place to get away––a safe house or under a dome––
  Tales from far away, and some close to home.
  Games–economic, scientific and video...
  A place to ask questions like you did as a kiddio
  And no matter how much we tried to dissuade
  Of Virtual Reality there’s a virtual parade:
  Memories and stories, trips to places you can’t go:
  The heart, back in time, a storm, fly like a pro.
  Educational, poetic, sometimes subversive
  360, AR,––interactive, immersive:
  Deployment and dragons,Taiwan, Standing Rock
  And several that ask us all to take stock:
  Is tech making us safer? It’s worth an unveiling
  To see what google, facebook et al are surveilling.
  Write your name in the sand in arabic script,
  Visit Trinidad, South America, India without taking a trip.
  You’ve built stuff in metal, wood, with light and in tubes
  With Algorithms, Unity, and 3 billion cubes.
  No thesis is needed (though we have one) to forecast your fortune
  Of brains, smarts, and kindness you’ve got a huge portion.
  Your futures are bright: You’re brave. And you’re strong.
  I could go on, but this poem’s a bit long.
  2017’s a prime number--like you,special and rare.
  Now Thesis is over. It’s time for a cheer!
