    Dear Class of 2016

    Obsession, shyness, stress and anxiety,
    Care for yourselves, the planet, society,
    Meditation, relaxation and spirituality
    360,P5, Augmented and Virtual Reality…
    You are the storytellers of a new generation
    And we salute you all with due veneration.
    Your stories are varied, we give you full credit––
    Orpheus & Eurydice, The Iliad and Reddit.
    Connected to Place, from all the four corners
    Indonesia and Brooklyn, Korea, California.
    You’re inventing new ways to view and to tell them
    In cardboard, on mobile..but how will you sell them?

    (No, no, you know we don’t talk about that!)

    You make us giggle ( and wiggle) with new interactions––
    Figured out ways to make young kids like fractions
    Play music while knitting, compose on the fly
    Make your body an instrument, perform when you’re shy
    ITP Chat bots, desk robots to charm and to cheer you
    What might happen when you’ve got a  car that will steer you
    Shake out your memories, chairs that makes you sit right
    And, wow, such an obsession with space, time and light!
    Tell time with your back, right down to the minute.
    Some spaces defined by the actions of those who are in it
    And others, when everyone’s calm, only then it enlivens.
    Your imagination, dear class, knows no bounds or horizons,

    A radical kindness is clearly apparent
    In projects that deal with the care of a parent,
    That reach out to new voters, make tools for non-profits,
    Tell stories of refugees, bias and other hard topics.
    A cornucopia of ways to make tech more accessible––
    Hardware, software, portable, flexible.
    A little old-fashioned, bucking the trends
    You say “There’s no such thing as 1000 Friends”
    You want to stay close to those people who matter,
    Reduce the distractions of way too much chatter
    Converse about art at home, in museums
    Or there on your screen where it’s easy to see ‘em
    Get a wake-up note from your far-away lover.
    Great projects that encourage us all to discover
    The playfulness of language, both verbal and non
    Inclusive fonts; Learning that’s fun.
    Art works this year, are emotional and plentiful
    Theoretical, virtual, magical, ephemeral.

    Finally we see the class portrait emerging
    107 bright stars whose future’s converging
    To better our world by your work and your presence
    And we come at last to this tribute’s true essence:
    Participate. Innovate. Motivate. Delight.
    Stay kind. Speak out. Have fun and excite.
    Dear Class of 2016, we just want to say
    We love you too much, please don’t go away.

    Cheers!
    Your Thesis Faculty
