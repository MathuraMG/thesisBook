      <p>TO THE CLASS OF 2017: <br/><br/>
      You’re whimsical, witty, obsessed and serious<br/>
      Outrageous, political, playful and curious,<br/>
      Rigorous, hard-working, goofy and thoughtful,<br/>
      Faced with a world, to put it mildly, distraught-ful.<br/>
      The collection of projects you produced this semester:<br/>
      Imaginative, mind-blowing, you deserve a siesta…<br/>
      For now I’ll offer a few illustrations…<br/>
      From Behavior Change to Museums, Installations,<br/>
      Music, Performance, Data, UI and UX<br/>
      (Though this year’s there’s really not much about sex)<br/>
      A few about gender, we’re not total prigs:<br/>
      Menstruation, Black beauty, drag–thermochromic wigs,<br/>
      Shirts that will bite you if you tell me to smile,<br/>
      Chatbots to organize, to converse with a child,<br/>
      A place to get away––a safe house or under a dome––<br/>
      Tales from far away, and some close to home.<br/>
      Games–economic, scientific and video...<br/>
      A place to ask questions like you did as a kiddio<br/>
      And no matter how much we tried to dissuade<br/>
      Of Virtual Reality there’s a virtual parade:<br/>
      Memories and stories, trips to places you can’t go:<br/>
      The heart, back in time, a storm, fly like a pro.<br/>
      Educational, poetic, sometimes subversive<br/>
      360, AR,––interactive, immersive:<br/>
      Deployment and dragons,Taiwan, Standing Rock<br/>
      And several that ask us all to take stock:<br/>
      Is tech making us safer? It’s worth an unveiling<br/>
      To see what google, facebook et al are surveilling.<br/>
      Write your name in the sand in arabic script,<br/>
      Visit Trinidad, South America, India without taking a trip.<br/>
      You’ve built stuff in metal, wood, with light and in tubes<br/>
      With Algorithms, Unity, and 3 billion cubes.<br/>
      No thesis is needed (though we have one) to forecast your fortune<br/>
      Of brains, smarts, and kindness you’ve got a huge portion.<br/>
      Your futures are bright: You’re brave. And you’re strong.<br/>
      I could go on, but this poem’s a bit long.<br/>
      2017’s a prime number--like you,special and rare.<br/>
      Now Thesis is over. It’s time for a cheer!</p>

      {/*<p>Dear Class of 2016</p>*/}

      {/*<p>Obsession, shyness, stress and anxiety,*/}
    {/*Care for yourselves, the planet, society,*/}
    {/*Meditation, relaxation and spirituality*/}
  {/*360,P5, Augmented and Virtual Reality…*/}
    {/*You are the storytellers of a new generation*/}
  {/*And we salute you all with due veneration.*/}
    {/*Your stories are varied, we give you full credit––*/}
    {/*Orpheus & Eurydice, The Iliad and Reddit.*/}
    {/*Connected to Place, from all the four corners*/}
  {/*Indonesia and Brooklyn, Korea, California.*/}
    {/*You’re inventing new ways to view and to tell them*/}
  {/*In cardboard, on mobile..but how will you sell them?*/}

    {/*(No, no, you know we don’t talk about that!)*/}

  {/*You make us giggle ( and wiggle) with new interactions––*/}
    {/*Figured out ways to make young kids like fractions*/}
  {/*Play music while knitting, compose on the fly*/}
  {/*Make your body an instrument, perform when you’re shy*/}
  {/*ITP Chat bots, desk robots to charm and to cheer you*/}
  {/*What might happen when you’ve got a  car that will steer you*/}
  {/*Shake out your memories, chairs that makes you sit right*/}
  {/*And, wow, such an obsession with space, time and light!*/}
    {/*Tell time with your back, right down to the minute.*/}
    {/*Some spaces defined by the actions of those who are in it*/}
  {/*And others, when everyone’s calm, only then it enlivens.*/}
    {/*Your imagination, dear class, knows no bounds or horizons,*/}

    {/*A radical kindness is clearly apparent*/}
  {/*In projects that deal with the care of a parent,*/}
    {/*That reach out to new voters, make tools for non-profits,*/}
                                                   {/*Tell stories of refugees, bias and other hard topics.*/}
    {/*A cornucopia of ways to make tech more accessible––*/}
    {/*Hardware, software, portable, flexible.*/}
      {/*A little old-fashioned, bucking the trends*/}
  {/*You say “There’s no such thing as 1000 Friends”*/}
    {/*You want to stay close to those people who matter,*/}
    {/*Reduce the distractions of way too much chatter*/}
  {/*Converse about art at home, in museums*/}
  {/*Or there on your screen where it’s easy to see ‘em*/}
  {/*Get a wake-up note from your far-away lover.*/}
    {/*Great projects that encourage us all to discover*/}
  {/*The playfulness of language, both verbal and non*/}
  {/*Inclusive fonts; Learning that’s fun.*/}
    {/*Art works this year, are emotional and plentiful*/}
  {/*Theoretical, virtual, magical, ephemeral.*/}

    {/*Finally we see the class portrait emerging*/}
  {/*107 bright stars whose future’s converging*/}
  {/*To better our world by your work and your presence*/}
  {/*And we come at last to this tribute’s true essence:*/}
    {/*Participate. Innovate. Motivate. Delight.*/}
      {/*Stay kind. Speak out. Have fun and excite.*/}
    {/*Dear Class of 2016, we just want to say*/}
  {/*We love you too much, please don’t go away.*/}

    {/*Cheers!*/}
    {/*Your Thesis Faculty</p>*/}
